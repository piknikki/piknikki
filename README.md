<img src="https://github.com/piknikki/piknikki/blob/master/logo.png" width="100">

I'm Nikki and I'm a Frontend Engineer, developer, and general nerd. I like to create things. Cool things. So if you know of something wicked cool, send it my way!

I'm currently working on learning Vue and Bulma, and am open to pretty much any collaboration on sweet projects. HMI.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once made a gingerbread Deathstar -- totally hollow and 100% edible, including the laser!
